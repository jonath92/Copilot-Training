# Introduction
We have a database docker container and now we want to add a backend service that interacts with the database. We do this by following the [Api first approach](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/). 

The default vscode copilot chat has the limitation that you only can have one session at a time. This makes it hard to work on multiple components of the application in parallel. In this task, we will explore how to use the Agent Sessions feature to work on multiple components in parallel.

# Task
- In the Agent Sessions of Visual Studio code, click on the plus icon next to the "Local Chat Agent"
