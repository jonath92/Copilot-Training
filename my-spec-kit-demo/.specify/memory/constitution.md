# Estimator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. API First
Design APIs before implementation. All functionality must be exposed through well-defined, documented interfaces. API contracts are the source of truth; implementation details are secondary.

### II. Test-Driven Development
TDD is mandatory: Write tests first → Verify tests fail → Implement code → Tests pass → Refactor. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. No production code without corresponding tests.
